# Sample Basic Blockchain code

Sample code to create a very basic private BlockChain using NodeJs

### Instructions
1. Run 'node' in terminal
2. Copy-paste code into terminal (You may want to remove comments before doing so)
3. Add block by instantiating blockchain, then adding blocks to it:
			
	// Instantiating new BlockChain <br>
	`blockchain = new BlockChain()`

	// Need to instantiate new Block when adding to a BlockChain <br>
	`blockchain.addBlock(new Block('Whatever goes in here'))`

	// To view <br>
	`blockchain.chain`
