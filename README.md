# Sample Basic Blockchain code

Sample code to create a very basic private BlockChain using NodeJs

### Instructions
1. Run 'node' in terminal
2. Copy-paste code into terminal (You may want to remove comments before doing so)
3. Add block by instantiating blockchain, then adding blocks to it:
			
      `// Instantiating new BlockChain
			blockchain = new BlockChain()
			
      // Need to instantiate new Block when adding to a BlockChain
			blockchain.addBlock(new Block('Whatever goes in here'))
			
      // To view
			blockchain.chain`
